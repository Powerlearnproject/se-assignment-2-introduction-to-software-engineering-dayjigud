1. DEFINE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
    Software engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to designing, developing, and maintaining software systems. Software engineering differs from traditional programming in several key ways:
        Process-oriented: Software engineering focuses on establishing and following well-defined processes and methodologies for software development. It emphasizes planning, documentation, and adherence to best practices and standards. Traditional programming, on the other hand, is often more ad-hoc and less structured.
        Teamwork and collaboration: Software engineering emphasizes collaboration among teams of developers, analysts, designers, and other stakeholders. It involves effective communication, coordination, and management of resources. Traditional programming is often viewed as a more individual activity.
        Scalability and maintainability: Software engineering aims to produce software systems that are scalable, maintainable, and extensible over the long term. It employs techniques such as modular design, code reusability, and documentation to facilitate future modifications and enhancements. Traditional programming may prioritize short-term goals over long-term sustainability.
        Quality assurance: Software engineering places a strong emphasis on quality assurance through rigorous testing, code reviews, and adherence to coding standards. It aims to produce software that is reliable, efficient, and meets the specified requirements. Traditional programming may lack a structured approach to quality assurance.
        Life cycle management: Software engineering follows a structured life cycle that includes phases such as requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. This life cycle approach ensures that each phase is properly addressed and documented. Traditional programming may not follow a well-defined life cycle.
        Tools and methodologies: Software engineering employs a variety of tools and methodologies to support the development process, such as integrated development environments (IDEs), version control systems, project management tools, and software development methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall).

2. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

        Enhances Quality: Leads to higher-quality software by ensuring that requirements are thoroughly analyzed and validated.
        Cost-Efficiency: Reduces rework and associated costs by getting the requirements right from the start.
5. SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
    Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing a software system into distinct, independent components or modules that encapsulate specific functionality. Each module is designed to operate independently, with well-defined interfaces that allow it to interact with other modules. This approach allows developers to manage complexity by breaking down large systems into more manageable pieces.
            How Modularity Improves Maintainability and Scalability
            Maintainability
        Code Readability: Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and navigate.
        Simplified Bug Fixes: Isolating bugs to specific modules reduces the time needed to identify and fix them.
        Consistent Documentation: Each module can be documented separately, making the documentation more focused and easier to maintain.
            Scalability
        Parallel Development: Teams can develop and deploy modules independently, allowing for faster scaling of development efforts.
        Flexible Deployment: Modules can be scaled independently based on demand. For example, a frequently used module can be replicated across multiple servers.
        Performance Optimization: Specific modules can be optimized without affecting the entire system, allowing for targeted performance improvements.
